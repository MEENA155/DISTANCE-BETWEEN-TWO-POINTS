# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## Equipements required:
PC
Anaconda-Python 3.7 installation.

## ALGORITHM: 

Step 1:
Import math function.

Step 2:
Assign the values of point 1 and point 2 whose distance is to be calculated.

Step 3:
Substitute the values in the distance formula formula

Step 4:
Print the coding to get the answer.

Step 5:
End the program.
### PROGRAM:
```
#Program to calculate the distance between two points.
#Developed by: S.Meena.
#RegisterNumber: 21500895
x1,x2=10,4
y1,y2=6,2
import math
value=math.sqrt((x2-x1)**2+(y2-y1)**2)
print("{:.2f}".format(value))
  ```


### OUTPUT:
![output](.//distancebetweenttwopoints.png)


### RESULT:
Thus finding the distance between two points is executed.
